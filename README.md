Title: Nonogram 
What is it about? 
Nonogram is a Japanese picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden pixel art-like picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets. 
I created a game based on these puzzles 

Libraries for building the game:
-	PyQt5 / PyGame / OpenCV / numpy / ImageWriter / PyGame 

Stages of the game development:
-	Stage 1: development of back-end 
•	Development of the back-end program built in tkinter that takes any photo and turns it into a pixel photo with desired size(5x5, 80x80) 
•	The same program takes the pixel photo and records its number of non-white pixels in columns and rows
-	Stage 2: development of front-end
•	Once we have the nonograms ready, create an interface and features for the game in PyGame
- Stage 3: development of AI NonoGram solver
